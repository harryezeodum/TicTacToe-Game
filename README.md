# TicTacToe-Game


**A Simple Game Console Application**
The logic would be for the users to input their names and play a row with any number between 0-2 
and the same concept for the column and that would play either 'X' for player 1 and 'O' for player 2.
You lose a turn if you decide to play on a spot that has already been played, and you cannot input letters
when playing, it has to be valid numbers that have been set. You win if you can get three 'X' or 'O' on the
same row, column or diagonal on either side and you get an option to either play again or exit.
